#The Art Of Programming By July 

This repo contains ebooks generated using tools from [The Art Of Programming By July](https://github.com/julycoding/The-Art-Of-Programming-By-July).

It's for you who want to read this execellent work by [July](https://github.com/julycoding) offline but has no intention / tools to build book on you own.

Build script havn't support **pdf** format. I'll try to fix it lately.

##Format contains

*	epub
*	mobi
*	html

##Html version

html is generated using pandoc. Pandoc doesn't build image into html files, so, while copy html into somewhere, you need to copy images directory as well

##TODO
Add Pdf format.
